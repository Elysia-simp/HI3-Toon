There are two things I didn't really include in this shader cause 1) too hard with dx9 or 2) didn't see the need at the moment

Those two things being the Stencil masking and Emissions

the alpha channel in the diffuse can be used for emmisions sometimes

and the red channel in the face lightmap can be used for stencil masking (not all characters use this)


There are a bunch of features I didn't use simply cause they're A) Done in realtime or B) they weren't used for the MAJORITY of these characters

This Shader is General use more than anything
