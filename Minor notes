There are two things I didn't really include in this shader cause 1) too hard with dx9 or 2) didn't see the need at the moment

Those two things being the Stencil masking and Emissions

the alpha channel in the diffuse can be used for emmisions sometimes

and the red channel in the face lightmap can be used for stencil masking (not all characters use this)
